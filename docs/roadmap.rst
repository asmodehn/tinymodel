Roadmap
=======

TODO, by order of priority:
"Atomic types":
- datetime (python data type, serialized to json via marshmallow )

"Product types":
- class (with a __hash__ method)

"Union types":
- choose an implementation


Later
=====

- Exponential types ?

- Investigate dill / klepto, they can provide a more generic / powerful implementation for these.
